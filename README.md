Data scraper de restaurantes e menus de Macapá, implementando um chatbot IA.

Overview of the Project
We'll build a Python-based web scraper to gather restaurant information in Macapá, including:

Restaurant names
Menus (dishes, prices)
Popular/local dishes
Customer reviews and ratings
This data will be stored in a SQLite database. Then, we’ll create an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about the restaurants, their menus, and local gastronomy trends using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Step-by-Step Plan
1. Data Mining: Web Scraping Restaurant Information
To get started, we'll scrape data from popular restaurant platforms like:

Google Maps
TripAdvisor
iFood (or any local platforms)
Using Python libraries:

BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for scraping
Selenium for dynamic content (if needed)
Requests for handling HTTP requests
Data to scrape:

Restaurant name
Menu (dishes, prices)
Address
Opening hours
Ratings/reviews
Keywords like "local dish," "Amazonian cuisine," etc.
Example code snippet to scrape basic information:

python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://www.restaurant-website.com/macapa'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Scrape restaurant names
restaurants = soup.find_all('div', class_='restaurant-name')
for restaurant in restaurants:
    name = restaurant.get_text()
    print(name)
2. Storing Data in a SQLite Database
Once we have scraped the data, we will store it in an SQLite database for easy access and analysis. The structure could look like this:

Restaurants Table

id (Primary Key)
name
address
ratings
cuisine_type
popular_dishes
menu_items
Menu Table

id (Primary Key)
restaurant_id (Foreign Key)
item_name
price
description
3. Analyzing the Data
After gathering and storing the data, we can analyze the most common local dishes and popular cuisines. You can use SQL queries to:

Identify the most frequently mentioned dishes.
Group restaurants by ratings and price ranges.
Example SQL query for most common dishes:

sql
Copy code
SELECT item_name, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM Menu 
GROUP BY item_name 
ORDER BY count DESC;
4. Building the AI Chatbot
To make this data accessible, we can develop an AI chatbot that responds to queries about Macapá restaurants, local dishes, or even recommend dining spots based on preferences (e.g., price, cuisine type).

Steps:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use libraries like spaCy or NLTK to process user queries.
Data Querying: Based on the user's question, query the SQLite database to retrieve relevant information.
Responding: The chatbot responds with useful answers (e.g., “The most popular dish in Macapá is...”).
For building the chatbot:

Langchain: For building a chatbot that can interact with your database.
OpenAI API: You can integrate ChatGPT-like models for generating human-like responses.
Flask/Django: To build a simple web interface where users can interact with the chatbot.
Example flow:

User asks: "What are the best restaurants for local Amazonian cuisine in Macapá?"
Chatbot queries the database for restaurants tagged with "Amazonian cuisine" and returns names, addresses, and popular dishes.
5. Enhancing the Chatbot with AI
Use machine learning to classify user requests (e.g., asking for price ranges, cuisine types).
Add sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews to provide insights into customer satisfaction.
Use embeddings to compare and rank dishes based on user preferences.
Next Steps
Start the Scraping: We can begin by selecting a few websites and testing scraping techniques for Macapá restaurants.
Set up the SQLite Database: Once data is scraped, we can organize and normalize it in SQLite.
Develop the Chatbot: Finally, we’ll integrate the scraped data into an AI system that can respond to user questions.
Would you like help setting up the scraper first, or should we start with defining the database schema?
